# MachRead

## What does it do?
The user selects a starting point and then clicks the toolbar button to begin Mach Reading.  It then moves from word to word,
highlighting each word in turn at the selected reading speed.  We also plan to add "anchor letter" coloring, and letter-tuned speed to balance the speed between longer and shorter words.

## How does it work?
Mach Read is based on research regarding speed reading.  Unlike similar plugins, Mach Read aids training in real world speed reading skills that can be in books as well as web browsers.
